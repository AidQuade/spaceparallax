     <h2> The Absurdity of Creation </h2>
     <p> We don't truly know how everything came to be, we have the most common scientific theory of the big bang, in which everything in the known universe exploded with extreme force out from a singularity.
       But how was the singularity created? How can we wrap our minds around the idea that something must have either always existed, or alternatively at one point nothing existed and somehow matter came into being. </p>

       <h2> Entropy and Time </h2>
       <div class="parallax_img parallax_img2" id="img2"></div>
       <p> What astronomers believe existed after the big bang was a universe so densely packed with matter everywhere, there was no empty space and all was uniform. However, nothing in nature can remain perfect forever and some areas
         contained very slight variations in density either %0.003 more or less dense in some areas.</p>
         <p> Given timespans a human mind cannot even imagine, even the tiny discrepancies this small over time began to destructure the uniform universe. Matter would gravitationally attract to the lightly more dense areas and leave voids
           where there was less density. Going on for eons eventually this began to look like what we call the Cosmic web, with the matter that clustered together making up the ligaments of the web and beggining to form the first stars and galaxies</p>

      <section id="structure">
        <h2> Matter is Drawn to Structure </h2>
        <p> The cosmic web continued to grow and spread however there was also dark matter with its strong gravitational attraction within the void spaces. This dark matter kept the web from growing too large and contributed to the way galaxies began to group together</p>
        <p> It seems that as much as there is chaos and the slow degradation of everything, there is also an equal force we dont understand for matter to continue to become more complex and form together structuring itself. From what started as
          just atoms of matter in the beggining now had over time formed stars, planets, cosmic dust, everything in existence in the universe today</p>

        <h2> Against All Odds </h2>
        <p> But it only becomes more unfathonamble to think that this all would lead to what happened on the planets. It seems highly unlikely that this process only happened on our single planet in our one of trillions of galaxies, but somehow despite the statistical improbability
          the chemical processes occuring on Earth eventually lead to life. Any life coming into existence alone is insane to think about from what started as star dust, but this life still began to go on a process of evolution. The evolution eventually leading to a sentient beign
          with the ability to realize its own existence is the most surreal of all <p>

         <h3>10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 planets</h3>
       </div>
         <p> With how statistically unprobable it is for human beings to exist, it brings the most sought after question we have searched for an answer to throughout our history. We may never truly know if there is a reasoning behind a concious being like us being created. We may never understand if this truly is just an insanely unlikely accident due to the natural processes of our universe, or if there is possibly something more we have yet to understand.
           The fact we are able to philosophize about this and each have our own experience of life makes it seem bleak if the truth is there is no reason or specialness at all.</p>

        <h2> Accepting the Unknown </h2>
        <div class="parallax-container">
          <h3> why are we here? </h3>
        </div>
        <p> Regardless of individual beliefs, we have to accept that there is things we will never understand in the current form of our existence. We know the universe is expanding exponentionally due to dark energy but have no idea what it is or what it means for the long term and possible end of the universe. Being able to perceive our existence and thinking of all this can lead to existential crisis, and by accepting the absurdity of the human condition it can be freeing. If there truly is no reason for all of the universe to come into being, then acceptance that our own personal meanings of life is just as freeing as it is daunting. </p>
